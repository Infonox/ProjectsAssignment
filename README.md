# ProjectsAssignment
 
 Johnny and I worked together to create a functional website where a user can search for information regarding different medicinal plants. Johnny developed a functioning Webcrawler which took words scanned from the UI search bar (where users enter key words), and looked up information from different websites. I worked on how words were scanned into the search bar and paired with PDF files that contained plant information.
 
 # What I Learned

 - More experience with Front-End/ Back-End development, Python programming language, Scanners, SQL/PHP communications.
