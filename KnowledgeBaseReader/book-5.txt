 IN MONGOLIAHabitat:
 Steppe debris and stony slopes, screes, rocks, sometimes on rocky areas and sands [1Œ5].
Parts used:
 Herb and root
Traditional Uses:
 The taste is sweet, bitter and potency is cool. It is used as the following: treating lung and chest 
fevers, and pneumonia. It is an ingredient of the following traditional prescriptions: Agar-3, 8, 15, 35, Garnag-6, Arur-
11, 12, 14, Banzdoo-6, Valo-7, 8, Banjangarvo-15, Gavar-9, Givan-13, Darvu-5, Jugan-25, 11, Lotsadgunsel, Mana-15,

Microscopic characteristics:
Root: Periderm four-layered. Below periderm is seen parenchyma layer. Parenchyma thin-walled, relatively dense. 
Collateral vascular bundle arranged in a ring [9]. 
Chemical constituents:
 Herb contains ˝avonoids, root contains coumarins [10], alkaloids, triterpene glycosides 
[11], cyclic peptides: dichotomins J, K [12], dichotomins H, and I [13], phenylpropanoid glycoside: dichotomoside E, 
neolignan glycosides: dichotomosides A, B, C, and D, 
-carboline-type alkaloid glycosides: glucodichotomine B [14], 
dichotomines A, B, C, D and dichotomides I and II [15]. 
Qualitive and quantitative assay:
 Triterpene glycosides are identi˚ed by the reaction to produce a foam and TLC. 
The following is a suitable TLC procedure to identify triterpene glycosides: silica gel, butanol-ethanol-25% ammonia 
(7:2:5) solvent system, detection reagent: strong sulphuric acid. After complete evaporation of the solvent in air, sprayed 
with detection reagent and heated at ca. 105°C; a pink spot is observed. Alkaloids are identi˚ed by the precipitation 
reaction. Total alkaloid and triterpene glycoside contents are determined gravimeticallyr [11].

 Loss on drying, not more than 13.0%. Ash, not more than 13.0%. Organic 
matter, not more than 1.0% and mineral matter, not more than 0.5%. 70% ethanol-soluble extractive, not less than
